# Deeplearning cookbook
This is a small repository that I build up while learning deep learning :). Maybe it will help other people to do the same. Mostly compiled and blended together from available tutorials, sometimes combined with own insights on methods and results.

There are two main goals:

- I'd like to understand, coming from "classical" machine learning techniques like Random Forest etc. whether Deep Learning can really help improve the models I am estimating for a living. These are mostly models with well-structured data and a supervised classification/regression task.
- I'd like to understand how Q-learning works and if I might be able to use this in a commercial setting. To get started a this, I first have to understand Deep Learning.

## Structure

This cookbook is structured into many lessons. They just follow my personal progress.

### Lesson 0: Simple neural network from scratch

I am using this to understand the basic concepts.

### Lesson 1: Logistic regression on the MNIST Dataset with a very simple Theano implementation

This is just to get to now Theano a bit. 

### Lesson 2 (tba) : Try different types of shallow, deep networks on the MNIST Dataset

This will be used to get the hang of Theano and Lasagne together. Also, I'd like to see if switching to real Deep Learning neural nets improves the results
